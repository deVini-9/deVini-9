Hey, what's up?

I'm Vin√≠cius Ferreira Vitorino, and you're relaxing on my profile!

Feel free to check out my repositories and contact me if you have any questions or just want to hang out!

I've been in the field of video editing and directing for more than a decade, but now I'm having a change of scenery.

I'm currently diving into some programming languages:

Learning has been tricky, and I'm leaving all my projects here, big or small, to keep the journey real!

Oh, and if you like my vibe, give feedback on my projects. It means a lot to me!
